# Lesson 1 - Setting up a working environment

# Words to define:
- Working environment
	- "A combination of the project structure in use and the tools used to work inside said structure"
- Code
	- "Instructions for a computer to run"
- Programming & coding
	- "The act of writing, editing, running, and debugging code"
- Project structure
	- "The files and folders used to contain a project"
	- A common example is "lib, src, bin"
- Source file/Source code
	- "A text file containing written code"
- Source folder
	- "A folder containing source files"
- Runnable/executable/binary
	- "The output of compiling a project, which can be executed on the system"
- Human readable
	- "Can be understood by a human. Source files are almost always human-readable, while executables are typically not"


# Working plan

1) Download and install the latest JDK
2) Create a new folder called "javalessons"
[
	Structure is:

	javalessons
]
3) Inside javalessons, create a folder named "lesson 1"
[
	Structure is:

	javalessons
	|__________> lesson 1	
]
4) Inside javalessons, create the following folders: "bin", "lib", "src"
[
	Structure is:

	javalessons
	|_________> lesson 1
	|__________________> bin
	|__________________> lib
	|__________________> src
]
5) Explain the usage of bin and src
- src, shorthand for "source" is used to contain code for a project. All code is written in "source folders", inside "source files".
- bin, shorthand for "binary" is used to contain compiled code for a project, in the form of runnables/executables.
- lib, shorthand for "library", set up to discuss later.

6) Check for understanding
- Do you understand how a project is laid out?
	- Names, layout, how to use the file explorer? What folder to keep things in?
	- If I asked you to create a new project folder for a project called "lesson a", could you do it?

7) Final assertion - Delete the entire javalessons folder. Create the project layout from scratch, without directions.
